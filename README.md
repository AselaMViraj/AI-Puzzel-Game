# AI Puzzle Solving Game

## Description

The AI Puzzle Solving Game is a classic 3x3 number puzzle whose goal is to rearrange the numbers in ascending order within a 3x3 grid. The game starts by randomly shuffling the numbers, and your task is to use your intelligence or let the built-in AI solve it for you!

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the PuzzelGame code.
3. Click on the puzzle pieces adjacent to the empty space to move them.
4. Continue moving the pieces until you arrange them in ascending order from 1 to 8, left to right, top to bottom.
5. If you get stuck or want to see the AI in action, click the "Solve" button to let the AI automatically solve the puzzle for you.

## AI Solver

The AI Solver is an intelligent algorithm that can solve the puzzle efficiently. It uses a search algorithm, such as the Best First Search algorithm, to find the optimal solution with the least number of moves. The AI's speed and efficiency may vary depending on the complexity of the puzzle.

## Technologies Used

- Python was used to build the game interface and functionality.
- The AI Solver algorithm is implemented in Python.
